# Hello there! 👋🏼 My name is Asia Thompson 😊

I’m a digital product designer, full-stack developer, and educator based in sunny southern California, with a love of learning and a passion for turning ideas into real products.  I specialize in building digital solutions that empower businesses and their users to achieve their goals. I love working with businesses of varying scales and on projects that I genuinely resonate with to deliver the best. Whether I’m in Figma designing a new product feature, in Visual Studio Code building a new interface or fixing bugs, optimizing a database, crafting a new blog or video, or chatting it up with a new client (which might be you) I’m always doing what I love!

Do you need work done for a job? Would you like to collaborate? Or, do you or have a question for me? 

Reach out to me through my [portfolio](https://asiathompson.dev/) or you can email me directly.
